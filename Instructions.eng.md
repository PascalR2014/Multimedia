# The idea of ​​the project

We want to create here a web application that provides the HTML API and uses the Audio and Video properties to be able to read the files with your player that you have created.

To help you, I provide you with a template, a skeleton of html, css, and javascript files as well as audio and video files so that you can read them once your application is finished.

## How to start?

First of all, you will have to link the Javascript and Css files with your Html file.

The goal is to get them to work together, of course!

## Find the right information

One of the secrets to being a good integrator, developer, ...

1. Knowing how to find the right information

Type this in your search engine

"audio and video html"

I took the first result that comes, for example:

Developer mozilla.org - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_delivery

* About this site is a mine of information to you to play the minors !!

Go ahead, there is more to implement the code in the right place in the different files that I am provided to you.

Copy - paste the code is easy !!

# Instructions for development


## The design part

## The basics

1. Use an Html, css, javascript stack

That you can expand if you feel like it with other languages ​​...

Adding the bootstrap framework seems wise !!

2. Please note that all file formats are not necessarily readable in all browsers. This is part of the joys of code.

3. the base then the different functionalities

Each file has a purpose and a destination ...

The HTML file is the skeleton of the project but it is also the link with all the other files.

Exactly the other files - CSS is for the style we will say the equivalent of the layer of paint on the wall of your room.

However, CSS has many other properties that you need to know to make a great project.

As for the Javascript file it is not there to make the figuration or act of presence, it will also be useful to us especially for all the management of the functionalities that you can regularly use with the youtube player for example.

Or even that of Deezer which is also a web application !!

Come on, let's build our app 'let's go !!
